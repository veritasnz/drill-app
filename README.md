## Next to implement

-   Investigate possibility of merging _drillState.currentLevelNum_ & _progressCtx.ctx.state.currentLevelNum_
-   Finalize design/animations
-   Switch _getAll~_ /lib/ functions to use _flatMap_ array method

Work for version 1.0:

-   Thorough testing
-   Finalize initial question content
-   Implement SEO features and publish to message boards
-   About page (/w MD parsing?)

Work for version 2.0:

-   Merge multiple-particle answers into one question
    -   _Question.question_ could be array of questions/answers? English and ID would stay the same
-   Switch to purely keyboard system
-   Huge architecture refactor
    -   Architectually re-think storing **_all_** `answeredIds` in progressContext
    -   Think of system to store answered levels and `answeredIds` separately
    -   Reduce re-renders
-   Move data to Supabase & replace all `import drillData` with fetch methods
-   Add system for Feedback email backups /w Supabase
-   Replace nodemailer with proper mailing solution
-   Documentation
-   Create more tests cases
